            <p>
                Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of giving variables a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as <b>containers that hold information</b>. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used through the entirety of your program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variables in JavaScript are containers which hold reusable data. In other words, they are units of storage, like some sort of <b>box</b> into which we can put <b>data</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the following three simple steps to creating a variable:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a variable with the appropriate name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Store your value in it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Retrieve and use the stored value from the variable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <i>
                <p>
                    The values that we store in our variables can come in the form of predefined Data Types. The computer needs to know of which type is our value so it can manipulate it properly. The lecture on Data Types is coming really soon in the course and it's going to explain all the details about them.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how can we create a variable? We need a var keyword, a variable name and the value we want to assign to that variable:
                </p>
                <code>
                    var variableName = 'Hello, World!';
                </code>
                <p>Just a note, you're always going to see me adding semi-colons at the end of lines.

                    Semicolons are used to terminate a line in javascript. They are optional, but omitting them can lead to undesired consequences on rare occasions. So it's a good practice to always put them at the end!</p>

            <h2>Variables (var, let, const)</h2>
            <p>In earlier versions of JavaScript, variables were solely declared using the var keyword followed by the name of the variable and a semicolon. This is how we would do it.</p>
            <code>var variableName = '';</code>
            <p>After ES6 (a newer version of JavaScript) we now have two new ways to declare a variable: <b>let</b> ****and ****<b>const</b>.</p>
            <p>We can take a look at both of them one by one. The variable type let shares lots of similarities with var but unlike var it has some scope constraints. The scope is out of "scope" of this introductory video but we will explain it in great detail in a later video! The only thing that you need to know right now is that let is the preferred way of creating variables in modern JavaScript.</p>
            <code>let variableName = '';</code>
            <p>Const is another variable type assigned to data whose value cannot and will not change throught the script.</p>
            <code>const variableName = '';</code>
            <p>The <b>variableName</b> is the name of the variable which you can freely choose. <br />

                What do you think, can we name our variables literally anything?<br />
                
                We have a few criteria when it comes to creating variable names, also known as <b>identifiers</b>.
                
            </p>
            <p>We have a few rules when it comes to creating an identifier in JavaScript:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the name of the identifier must be unique</li>
                <li>the name of the identifier should not be any reserved JavaScript keyword (for example, we cannot declare a variable like this: <b>var let = 0;</b></li>
                <li>the first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters may be any letter or digit or an underscore or dollar sign.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>To recap, there are three different ways to make (or declare) a variable: var, let and const.<br/>

            From now on, whenever we're creating a new variable, we're going to use either the const or the let keyword. const when variable is going to be constant and let when we plan on changing it!</p>
