    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>‘String’ is a sequence of characters.</li>
            <li>String is a data type used to represent text.</li>
            <li>Strings are simply fields of text. To wrap these words, we use quotes.</li>
            <li>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes: <b>Single quotes, Double quotes, Backticks</b>:</p>
        <code>const singleQuotes = 'Hello, everyone!';
            const doubleQuotes = "Hello, everyone!";</code>
        <ul>
            <li>Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in <b>${…}</b>, for example:</li>
        </ul>
        <code>const backticks = `Hello, everyone! ${2 + 2}`</code>
        <p>The expression inside ${…} is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything in there: a variable like name or an arithmetical expression like 1 + 2 or something more complex.

            It is important to note that we can inspect the type of each value by writing tyepof before the value. </p>
