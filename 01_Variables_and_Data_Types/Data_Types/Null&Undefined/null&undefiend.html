        <h1>Data Type - Null & Undefiend</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>NULL</h2>
        <p>This type has only one value: null</p>
        <p>It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:</p>
        <pre><code>let age = null;</code></pre>
        <i>null is just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.</i>
        <h2>UNDEFINED</h2>
        <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined</p>
        <p>The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

            If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined by default:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let x;

                console.log(x);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Technically, it is possiable to assign undefined to any variable:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let x = 123;

                x = undefined;

                alert(x); // "undefined"
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>…But I wouldn't recommend doing that. Normally, we use null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a variable, and we use undefined for checks like seeing if a variable has been assigned.</p>
        <h3>UNDEFINED VS NULL</h3>
        <p>Many a times we often get confused on whats the difference between UNDEFINED and NULL. <br />

            undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.<br />
            
            Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.<br />
            
            Unassigned variables are initialised by JavaScript with a default value of undefined. JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.</p>
