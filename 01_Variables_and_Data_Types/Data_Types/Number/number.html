    <main>
        <p>JavaScript is real friendly when it comes to numbers, because you don’t have to specify the type of number. We call this behavior untyped. JavaScript is untyped because determining whether a number is an integer or a decimal(float) is taken care of by the language’s runtime environment.</p>
        <p>For example, in traditional programming languages like C, we'd have declare the type of the number we'd like to use. Like this:</p>
        <code>int wholeNumber = 5;
            float decimalNumber = 0.5;</code>
        <p>In JavaScript, we can just say use plain old <b>const</b> or <b>let</b> and use any number we'd like:</p>
        <code>const wholeNumber = 5;
            const decimalNumber = 0.5;</code>
        <p>There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

            When we try to do some operations with values that are not numbers, most often, we will get NaN as a result. NaN simply means, not a number, it represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation.</p>
        <i>alert("this is a string" * 3);</i><br />
        <i>console.log(tyepof NaN);</i>
        <p>The type of NaN, which stands for Not a Number is, surprisingly, a number. The reason for this is, in computing, NaN is actually technically a numeric data type. However, it is a numeric data type whose value cannot be represented using actual numbers.</p>
