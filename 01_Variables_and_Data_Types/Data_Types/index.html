            <h2>Data Types General</h2>
            <p>We can separate data types of current JavaScript Standard in two groups:</p>
            <b>Primitive Data Types:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.</li>
                <li>String: “Hello everyone, I'm glad that you're here!” etc.</li>
                <li>Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.</li>
                <li>Null: This type has only one value : null.</li>
                <li>Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.</li>
                <li>Symbol: used as an identifier for object properties.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Complex Data Types:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will learn about these data types in details in further articles.</p>

            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>A comment is text in the code which is not read while we're running the code. You should write comments to explain what your code does.<br />

                Comments make your code easier to read and understand. They can help you and others who read your code.</p>
            <p>There are two types of comments: multi-line and single-line comments.</p>
            <h4>Multi-line comments</h4>
            <p>To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you can use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with */ , closing it into a neat little rectangle. Anything between these characters is not processed by the JavaScript interpreter.

                Multi-line comments are often used for descriptions of how script works.</p>
            <h4>Single-line comments</h4>
                <p>In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash // characters on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter. Single line comments are often used for short descriptions of what the code is doing.

                    Good use of comments will help you if you come back to your code after several days or months. They also help those who are new to your code.</p>

            <h2>There are two types of languages when it comes to data types:</h2>
            <p><i>Statically typed language</i> where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. Example: C, C++, Java.

            </p><br/>
            <p><i>Dynamically typed languages</i> can receive different data types over time. JavaScript is dynamically typed; variables in JavaScript can receive different data types over time. We're going to see this in action really soon.</p>
