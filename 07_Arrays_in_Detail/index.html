            <h2>Arrays Intro</h2>
            <p>In programming, quite often we will need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, 2nd, 3rd element and so on. For example, we need that to store a list of something: users, items, elements etc.<br/>

                There exists a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.
            </p>
            <b>Declaration</b><br/>
            <pre>
                This is how we declare an array - the most important part here are the square brackets:
                <code>
                    const months = [ 'January', 'February', 'March', 'April' ];
                </code>
                Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.

                We can get an element by its number in square brackets:
                <code>
                    console.log(months[0]); // 'January'
                </code>
                We can replace an element:
                <code>
                    months[2] = 'Not March'; // [ 'January', 'February', 'Not March', 'April' ]
                </code>
                â€¦Or add a new one to the array:
                <code>
                    months[4] = 'May'; // [ 'January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May' ]
                </code>
                The total count of the elements in the array is its length:
                <code>
                    console.log(months.length); // 5
                </code>
                An array can store elements of any type:
                <code>
                    const arr = [ 
                            'Apple', 
                        { name: 'John' }, 
                        true, 
                        function() { 
                            alert('hello'); 
                        } 
                    ];
                </code>
                You're often going to find yourself needing to loop through all the elements of an array. That's where the for loop we've learned comes in handy:
                <code>
                    for (let i = 0; i < months.length; i++) {
                        console.log(carr[i]);
                    }
                </code>

            <h2>Array Methods</h2>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const names = [ 'Jon', 'Bob', 'David', 'Mark' ];

                    // Array Push - Adds a new value to the end of the array.
                    names.push('Dean');

                    // Array Pop - Deletes the last element of an array
                    names.pop();

                    // Array Shift - Deletes the first element of an array
                    names.shift();

                    // Array Unshift - Adds a new value to the start of an array
                    names.unshift('Dean');

                    // Array Splice - It adds/removes values from any position of an array
                    names.splice(2, 2);

                    // Array Slice - Copies certain parts of an array into a newely created array
                    const noOneLikesJon = names.slice(1);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Aside from containing variables at indexes, an array contains a variety of premade functions with which you can manipulate it's data, like adding or removing elements at certain positions! Let's take a look at a few of the most basic ones right now.</p>
            <b>array.push(value)</b><br/>
            <pre>
                The array.push() function adds a new element, containing the entered variable, to the end of the array.
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    names.push("Dean");

                    console.log(names); // ["Jon","Bob","David","Mark","Dean"]
                </code>
                There's one important thing that many experienced web developers don't know about array.push(). What's it's the return value? Many would think that the return value of the push would be an array, now including the element we've pushed. Let's test it out:
                <code>
                    console.log(names.push('Dean')); // 5
                </code>
                The return value is 5. Hmm, why 5? Think about it.

                It turns out that the array.push() returns the length of the array when the element is pushed.

                We can even store it in a variable:
                <code>
                    const length = names.push('Dean');

                    console.log(length); // 5
                </code>
            </pre>

            <b>array.pop()</b><br/>
            <pre>
                The array.pop() function on the other hand, does quite the opposite, deleting the last element of an array.
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    names.pop();

                    *c*onsole.log(names); // ["Jon","Bob","David"]
                </code>
                This time, the return of the method is not the final length of the array, as it is with array.push(), rather, it's the value of the removed element. You have it in case you need it somewhere.
                <code>
                    const removedValue = names.pop();

                    console.log(removedValue); // "Mark"
                </code>
                This can be great for transferring data between two arrays or just giving a value one final use before popping it into the void.

            </pre>

            <b>array.shift()</b><br/>
            <pre>
                Shift works almost exactly like pop, with one major difference. It deletes the first value in an array and moves the rest backwards!
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    names.shift();

                    console.log(names); // ["Bob","David","Mark"]
                </code>
                It too returns the "popped" value.
                <code>
                    const removedValue = names.shift();

                    console.log(removedValue); // "Jon"
                </code>
         
            </pre>

            <b>array.unshift(value)</b><br/>
            <pre>
                If shift is the sister function to pop, unshift is that to push. It adds a new value to the start of an array instead of the end!
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    names.unshift("Dean");

                    console.log(names); // ["Dean","Jon","Bob","David","Mark"]
                </code>
                Much like push, it returns the new array length.
                <code>
                    const length = names.unshift('Dean');

                    console.log(length); // 5
                </code>
           
            </pre>

            <b>array.splice()</b><br/>
            <pre>
                Now this one is a little more sophisticated, but don't worry we'll walk you through it. The splice method allows you to "splice" values into the array. It's first parameter determines where the new element or elements are placed, the second how many after that point should be deleted before placement and each subsequent condition is merely an element you wish to add. Here's an example
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    names.splice(2, 0, "Jenny", "Johnny");

                    console.log(names); // ["Jon","Bob", "Jenny", "Johnny", "David","Mark"]
                </code>
                It can also return an array of any deleted items, like pop!
                <code>
                    const removedValue = names.splice(0,1);

                    console.log(removedValue); // ["Jon"]
                </code>
        
            </pre>

            <b>array.slice()</b><br/>
            <pre>
                And finally, the slice function. This handy little piece of code can make a new variable that contains every element from a certain point on in whatever array you feed it!
                <code>
                    const names = ["Jon", "Bob", "David", "Mark"];

                    const noOneLikesJon = names.slice(1);

                    console.log(noOneLikesJon); // ["Bob","David","Mark"]
                </code>
          
            </pre>

            <h2>Array ForEach</h2>
            <b>What is array.forEach method?</b><br/>
            <pre>
                Here is a real example where array.forEach can be used.
                <code>
                    let sum = 0;
                    const numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4];

                    numbers.forEach((number) => {
                        sum += item;
                    });

                    console.log(sum); // 125
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Basically, this method performs an action for each element in the array. We can use the standard for loop to do the same, but I will explain it soon where and why to use this method.<br/>

                Let's take an example - we have to log each of the values present in an array called *myArray* to the console, along with their respective indices, here's how we can do it using the standard for loop:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let names = [ 'Jon', 'Jenny', 'Johnny' ];

                    for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
                        console.log(i, names[i]);
                    }

                    // 0 'Jon'
                    // 1 'Jenny'
                    // 2 'Johnny'
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>In this case, we have to declare and initialize another variable i and then the loop compares it every time with the array.length, if the expression evaluates to true then only the loop executes. After the loop body is executed, the value of i increments by one.<br />

                We can eliminate this process using array.forEach method!</p>
            <b>Syntax of array.forEach</b><br/>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    array.forEach((value, index) => {
                        // ...
                    });
                </code>
                The first argument of the forEach method is the function that you want to execute for each element of the loop. This callback function can have three arguments. The first argument is the value of the current element the loop is on, the second argument is the index of the current value.

                So, we can perform the same action using forEach in this manner:
                <code>
                    let names = [ 'Jon', 'Jenny', 'Johnny' ];

                    names.forEach((value, index) => {
                        console.log(value, index);
                    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            <b>Using a named function as a Callback</b><br/>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function logArrayElement(element, index) { 
                        console.log(element, index);
                    }
                    
                    myArray.forEach(logArrayElement);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <b>Return value of array.forEach()</b><br/>
            <pre>
                This method returns undefined and this method is not chainable i.e. you can't call one method after another on an array when using forEach method, and so you cannot use cascading notation with forEach method.
                <code>
                    et returnValue = myArray.forEach(function (value) {
                        console.log(value);
                    });
                    
                    console.log(returnValue); // undefined
                </code>
                Typically, this method is used to execute side effects at the end of a chain such as logging all the elements in the array after performing a series of actions on the array.
            </pre>
            <b>Important remarks on the use of this method</b><br/>
            <p>Use When</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Callback function is to be executed on every single element of the array.</li>
                <li>Improve performance (provided first condition is satisfied).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Don't Use When</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You want to stop or break the loop when some condition is true, for example, you want to console log elements of myArray but break the loop if the value of the current element is 3, then I will compulsorily have to use standard for loop to be able to do so.</li>
                <li>The callback function is asynchronous. Instead use the standard for loop.</li>
            </ol>

                    // A local shop's inventory

                        { price: 5, name: 'eggs'  }, 
                        { price: 5, name: 'ham'  },
                        { price: 5, name: 'mayo'  },
                        { price: 5, name: 'bread'  },
                    ];

                    const prices = inventory.map(item => item.price);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Difference between Array.map() and Array.forEach() is that the map() method allocates memory in order to store and return values. While the forEach() method does not allocate memory so it doesn't store any returned values. In the last lecture, we saw that the array.forEach() method has a return value of undefined.</p>
            <p>The for each method also allows for a callback function that will allow you to change the original array, while the map method will instead return a new array while leaving the original one in its original state.</p>
